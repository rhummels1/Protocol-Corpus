This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study.

The trial includes a Run-in Period (if stable conventional treatment needed), a 4-week Screening
Period, a 12-week Treatment Period, and a 3-week Safety Follow-up Period to Day 105.

90 patients will be centrally, dynamically, randomly assigned to 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 600mg
TJ301 biweekly (Q2W), 300mg TJ301 Q2W or placebo Q2W. TJ301 or placebo administrations
will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70. Randomisation will be stratified by prior
corticosteroids treatment (yes/no) and consent to participate in PK substudy (yes/no).

During the treatment period and the follow-up period, patients should be on stable conventional
treatment for UC in double-blind except for those who cannot tolerate the stable conventional
treatment. Conventional treatment for UC can be the concomitant UC treatment or UC treatment
previously received by the patient, including corticosteroids at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or
equivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), and/or with
azathioprine (AZA)/mercaptopurine (6-MP).

Study Flowchart




There will be 9~10 main visits at the investigational site during the study:
    •    Visit 0: Run-in period: at an optional visit (Visit 0), decision will be made if patients need
         stable conventional UC treatment to meet the following criteria: with corticosteroids stable
         for at least 2 weeks prior to Randomization at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or
         equivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) at no less than
         2 g 5-ASA per day for at least 3 months and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
         Randomization, and/or with azathioprine (AZA) at no less than 1.5 mg/kg/day or
         mercaptopurine (6-MP) at no less than 0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months and stable for at

    •    Visit 9: Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP (Day 105).

Clinical assessments of disease activity will take place at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2
(Randomisation Visit), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8),
Visit 7 (Week 10), and Visit 8 (Week 12). During Screening and at Visit 8 (Week 12), assessments
of disease activity will also include endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy); mucosal biopsies
for assessment of mucosal healing, histology, immunohistochemistry will be collected during
endoscopy at these time points.

TJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm;
electronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for
PK subgroup will be collected as follows:
· At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h
  after the start of the 1st administration;
· At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at the
  end of infusion;
· At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336
  (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration.
The actual sampling time will be recorded.
For patients completing the last dose of IMP, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled to Day
105 (Week 15). For patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35
days (5.8 - 6.6 half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP.

NUMBER OF PATIENTS
In total, 90 patients with active UC will be enrolled competitively, and randomised equally into
three arms with TJ301 (two dose levels) or placebo.

Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
The IMP in this trial is TJ301 (FE 999301, Olamkicept (proposed INN)) (15 mg/mL in solution for
injection [25 mM histidine, 200 mM sucrose, 0.1 mg/mL Polysorbate 20 in aqueous solution]). The
placebo is the solution for injection [25 mM histidine, 200 mM sucrose, 0.1 mg/mL Polysorbate 20
in aqueous solution] without TJ301.

Both placebo and TJ301 should be stored at -20±5 °C and thawed at the site by site personnel (blind
to study randomisation) and diluted in 250 mL 5% (w/v) glucose. The infusion time is 2 hours.

The following concentrations and infusion volumes of TJ301 and placebo will be used:

STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size
A sample size of N=72 (n=24 per treatment/placebo arm) patients is expected to achieve a power of
83% of detecting a trend (p<0.05, one-sided) if the true remission rate difference (at Week 12)
between the placebo and highest dose groups (600 mg Q2W) is 30% (10% for the placebo and 40%
for the highest dose) using Pearson’s chi-square test without continuity correction. The trial also

has 70% power to reach a statistically significant result (p<0.05, one-sided) in case the remission
rate difference between placebo and treatment (300 mg Q2W and 600 mg Q2W combined together)
is 20% (10% vs 30%). Considering the dropout rate of approximately 20%, a total of 90 patients
will be enrolled competitively.

Data Analyses

Quantitative variables will be described with the number of non-missing values, mean, standard
deviation (SD), median, and minimum/maximum values. Qualitative variables will be described
with the number and percentage of patients with each qualitative characteristic. Missing values will
not be included in the calculation of percentages. All data will be listed by individual patient and
study visit.

The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical and endoscopic remission at Week 12. This binary
outcome (remission status=yes/no) variable will be analysed by a logistic regression model. A
patient with missing data on the remission status will be assumed to be not in remission.

All dichotomised secondary endpoints will be analysed using a repeated logistic regression model
and continuous endpoints will be analysed using a repeated measures Analysis of Covariance
(ANCOVA) model.

In addition, patients in both the placebo and the treatment groups will be split into subgroups based
on the baseline level of IL-6/sIL-6R complexes. Comparison in endpoints will be made for different
subgroups.

Safety analyses will be summarized descriptively by treatment groups. No statistical testing for
comparison of treatment groups will be performed for safety variables.

The PK parameters will be derived using noncompartmental method. The PK of TJ301 will be
summarized using descriptive statistics.

1      INTRODUCTION

1.1       Background
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic
cells, e.g. in response to infection and tissue damage. IL-6 is believed to be a key mediator in
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; i.e.
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis [UC]).

IL-6 exerts its multiple biological activities through two main signalling pathways. One is the so-
called classic ligand-receptor pathway via membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) present mainly
on hepatocytes and certain leukocytes. The second is the trans-signalling pathway via circulating
soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) originating from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound IL 6R or
from alternative splicing (1)(2). While the classic IL-6 signalling is involved in the acute
inflammatory response, trans-signalling is mainly involved in chronic inflammation and has been
shown to prevent disease-promoting mucosal T-cell populations from going into apoptosis. A
schematic presentation of the trans-signalling pathway of IL-6 is shown in Figure 1.

Patients with Crohn’s disease and UC have been found to produce increased levels of IL-6 when
compared with controls, the IL-6 levels being correlated to clinical activity (3)(4)(5)(6). Crohn’s
disease and UC patients have also been found to have increased levels of sIL-6R and consequently,
IL 6/sIL-6R complex in serum (4)(5)(6).

TJ301 (FE 999301, Olamkicept (proposed INN)) is a first-in-class, selective IL-6 trans-signalling
inhibitor and anti-inflammatory biologic that is under development for the treatment of UC and
Crohn’s disease. TJ301 is a selective IL-6/sIL-6R complex trap consisting of two complete
extracellular domains of gp130, the common signal transducer of IL-6-type cytokines, dimerised by

Solution for Injection                                                                           Ver.1.1
Clinical Trial Protocol                                                              Supersedes: Ver.1.0
                                                                                           Page 23 of 97

fusion to the fragment crystallisable region (Fc region) of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).
TJ301 targets and neutralises the IL-6/sIL-6R complex thereby inhibiting the trans-signalling
pathway, without any interaction with either IL-6 or IL-6R individually, which is different from
other anti-IL6 or anti-IL6R products in development to block IL-6 two signaling pathways. TJ301
is expected to be as effective as existing biologics but safer and more suited for early and long-term
use.

1.2      Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of TJ301 (FE 999301) have been
investigated in Germany in two phase 1, single- and multiple-ascending dose clinical studies in
healthy and Crohn’s disease subjects with up to 4 weeks of weekly intravenous (i.v.) infusion.
These studies showed dose-proportional systemic exposure, in the dose range of 0.75 mg to 750 mg,
with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 5 days and no apparent dose-dependent trends in
the incidence or nature of adverse events. Furthermore, a cohort of patients with quiescent Crohn’s
disease demonstrated similar systemic exposure to that in healthy subjects, for corresponding doses
of 75 mg, 300 mg, and 750 mg in the single-ascending-dose trial.

The purpose of this proof-of-concept trial is to assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of two different doses of i.v. infusions of
TJ301 in patients with active UC. The ability to induce remission of TJ301 will be investigated in
the 12-week double-blind treatment period of the study.

1.3      Benefit / Risk Aspects
For patients with active UC, 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) is considered a first-line treatment, either
as oral or topical (e.g. suppositories, enema) formulations. 5-ASA has a benign safety profile with
dosing in active disease of up to several grams a day, but is not effective in all patients.

Oral, systemic corticosteroids are used for induction of remission in patients not responding to
5-ASA. Corticosteroids have frequent and occasionally serious side effects, e.g. hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis suppression, hyperglycaemia/insulin resistance, cataracts, and
osteoporosis (notably, IBD itself is a risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis, with Crohn’s patients
being most affected), and systemic corticosteroids are therefore undesirable in maintenance
treatment. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) (i.e.
thiopurines), are used as steroid-sparing agents in steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory patients,
in induction as well as maintenance treatment (7)(8), but are associated with an increased risk for
malignancies (9). Since thiopurines and corticosteroids are not effective in all patients and
especially in the moderately to severely active IBD patient population, there is a need for novel,
effective and safe second- and even third-line treatment options.

In conclusion, patients with active UC are representative of the target population for TJ301, and
should present the opportunity to detect a larger effect due to more pronounced disease activity at
Baseline.

3.1.1        Trial Design Diagrams

A schematic overview of trial design is shown in Figure 2.

3.1.2        Overall Design
This is a multicenter, stratified randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study.
The trial includes a Run-in Period (if stable conventional treatment needed), a 4-week Screening
Period, a 12-week double-blind Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up Period of 3 weeks to
Day 105.
90 patients will be centrally, dynamically, randomly assigned to 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive 600mg
TJ301 biweekly (Q2W), 300mg TJ301 Q2W or placebo Q2W. Randomisation will be stratified by
prior corticosteroids treatment (yes/no) and consent to participate in PK substudy (yes/no). TJ301
or placebo administrations will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70.
During the double-blind period and the follow-up period, patients should be on stable conventional
treatment for UC.
There will be 9 ~ 10 main visits at the investigational site during the study:
      •   Visit 0: Run-in Period: at an optional visit (Visit 0), decision will be made if patients need
          stable conventional UC treatment to meet the following criteria: with corticosteroids stable
          for at least 2 weeks prior to Randomization at no more than 20 mg prednisone (or
          equivalent), and/or with medications containing 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) at no less than
          2 g 5-ASA per day for at least 3 months and stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
          Randomization, and/or with azathioprine (AZA) at no less than 1.5 mg/kg/day or
          mercaptopurine (6-MP) at no less than 0.75 mg/kg/day for at least 6 months and stable for at
          least 6 weeks prior to Randomization. If patients already met the criteria, they will directly
          enter the Screening Period (Visit 1). If not, they will need stable conventional UC treatment
          during the Run-in Period except those who cannot tolerate the medications mentioned above.
      •   Visit 1: Screening Visit, start of Screening Period (Days -28 to -1 prior to Visit 2)
      •   Visit 2: Randomisation Visit (Baseline), start of 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period
      •   Visits 3-7: 5 visits during 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period
      •   Visit 8: End of Treatment (EoT) Visit, completion of 12-week Double-blind Treatment
          Period
      •   Visit 9: Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP (Day 105).

Clinical assessments of disease activity will take place at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2
(Randomisation Visit), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8),
Visit 7 (Week 10), and Visit 8 (Week 12). During Screening and at Visit 8 (Week 12), assessments
of disease activity will also include endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy); mucosal biopsies
for assessment of mucosal healing, histology, immunohistochemistry will be collected during
endoscopy at these time points.
TJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm;
electronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for
PK subgroup will be collected in as follows:
    •    At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h
         after the start of the 1st administration;
    •    At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at
         the end of infusion;
    •    At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336
         (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration.
The actual sampling time will be recorded.

The schedule of blood sampling for PK assessment allows the evaluation of PK profiles after single
dose and after multiple doses in patients with UC. Considering the terminal plasma half-life of 5.3 –
6.0 days for TJ301 in healthy volunteers, the last blood sample will be collected at 840 hours
(5.8~6.6 half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose. Also due to the long half-life of TJ301, the
scheduled sparse blood sampling would be able to capture the PK profile of TJ301.

In order to ensure that standard therapy is not withheld from patients not gaining sufficiently from
IMP treatment, patients suffering a worsening in disease after Visit 5 are to be withdrawn.
Worsening will be defined as an increase from last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, over
3 consecutive days (Appendix 1). Such worsening should be evaluated by the Investigator and
confirmed by endoscopy (no improvement or worse) prior to deciding whether or not to withdraw
the patient.

For patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35 days (5.8 - 6.6
half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP. For patients completing the 12-week Treatment
Period, likewise a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled at 35 days after the last dose of IMP
(Days 105).

3.1.3      Trial Schedule
First patient first visit is planned for Third Quarter 2017 and last patient last visit is planned for
First Quarter 2020. The expected total duration of the trial is approximately 2.5 years.

3.2       Planned Number of Patients
In total, 90 patients with active UC at approximately 25-30 investigational sites globally will be
enrolled competitively and randomised equally into three arms with TJ301 (two dose levels) or
placebo.

3.3      Safety Review Committee
A Safety Review committee (SRC) will be established. The SRC is an expert advisory group
commissioned and charged with the responsibility of evaluating, primarily, cumulative safety data
at regular intervals. The SRC will review blinded data and provide recommendations to the Sponsor
based on their evaluation.

During the conduct of the trial, the responsibilities of the SRC will be to periodically review safety
data, evaluate any safety concerns, and make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding trial
conduct and possible trial modifications. The SRC will comprise at least a medical monitor, a

3.4       Discussion of Overall Trial Design

3.4.1       Trial Design
This trial is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial of
TJ301. Patients will be on concomitant treatment with stable doses of corticosteroids, or
immunomodulators, or 5-ASA/sulfasalazine – all first- or second-line standard of care in UC – for
at least the duration of the 12-week Treatment Period (i.e. up to the primary endpoint). Two dose
levels of TJ301 will be investigated, and as discussed in Section 3.4.4, modelling of the effect on a
PD biomarker, based on PK measurements over a wide range of serum concentrations of TJ301,
suggests that the chosen dosages may show a dose-dependent clinical efficacy.

The typical duration of induction treatment in active UC, both in clinical practice and in clinical
trials, is at least 8 weeks. The novel mechanism of action with TJ301, with blockade of only IL-6
trans-signalling, may influence the time to a clinically relevant endpoint such as clinical remission.
In order to capture the full extent of the potential treatment effect, the primary endpoint will be
assessed at Week 12. As shown in the recent proof-of-concept trial with etrolizumab (10) in a

Clinical Trial Protocol                                                               Supersedes: Ver.1.0
                                                                                            Page 30 of 97

similar trial population as the one proposed with TJ301, placebo response was higher earlier during
the treatment course (at Week 6 as opposed to Week 10). Thus, more substantive ‘true’ response
and remission rates can be expected with longer treatment duration.

3.4.2       Selection of Endpoints
The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint will be a binary endpoint of clinical and
endoscopic remission at Week 12, defined as a full Mayo score ≤2, no individual subscore >1, and
rectal bleeding subscore = 0. The full Mayo score (range, 0-12; higher score is worse) is based on
the clinician’s scoring of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as endoscopic scoring of gross
colonic mucosal inflammation. While there is no validated scale for scoring the severity of
inflammation or clinical symptoms in UC, the Mayo score has been extensively used in earlier
clinical trials in UC, and shows a good correlation between the full Mayo score and the clinician-
rated components only (partial Mayo score without endoscopy; see Section 7.1.1 for details). The
partial Mayo score without endoscopy can be used to accurately predict inflammatory activity, and
the evolution of a treatment effect even in the absence of endoscopy.

Nevertheless, the endoscopic component of the Mayo score allows a direct assessment of the
inflammatory activity, which is suitable in a proof-of-concept setting. This should allow a more
robust correlation between clinical efficacy outcomes, PK parameters, and PD effects.

3.4.3       Blinding
A central, computer-based randomisation procedure is used to eliminate selection bias. To reduce
the risk of breaking the blind, IMP thawing and reconstitution will be carried out at the trial site by
blinded site personnel, independent of the Investigator and the Sponsor. The appearance of the
reconstituted IMP, as well as the infusion volume (290 mL) will be identical for all treatment
groups.

In order to reduce bias as much as possible, the trial is double-blind, keeping all subjects and the
investigator blinded to the treatment. The randomisation list will not be available to any person
involved in the conduct and evaluation of the trial until the trial database is locked.

3.4.4     Selection of Doses in the Trial
The safety and tolerability of TJ301 have been investigated in phase 1, single- and multiple-
ascending dose studies in both healthy subjects and patients with quiescent IBD (Crohn's disease)
up to 750 mg without any concern. Pharmacokinetic results indicate dose proportionality in
maximal concentration obtained (Cmax) and overall exposure (AUC) with a terminal half-life of
approximately 4.7 days.

The doses and dose frequency selected for this trial are within a dose range that is considered safe
and tolerable in healthy subjects and patients, trying to limit the number of i.v. infusion events.

Evidence from treatment with infliximab and etanercept indicate that a higher dose requirement in
IBD compared to RA and psoriasis and may also vary between disease states. The low systemic

exposure in IBD can partly be explained by demographics of the patient population, development
of antibodies to the drug and administration of concomitant immunomodulators, but could also be
related to a disease state.

Lamina propria mononuclear cells obtained from surgical colon specimens from patients with
Crohn’s disease and UC showed that both CD4+ T-cells and macrophages produced increased
amounts of IL-6 compared to controls (11). sIL-6R was found to be released via shedding from the
surface of macrophages and mononuclear cells with increased production associated with elevated
levels of IL-6. Mucosal T-cells from IBD patients have showed strong evidence for IL-6 trans-
signalling with activation of STAT-3, and the anti-apoptotic factors bcl-2 and bcl-xl. Treatment
with TJ301 is anticipated to induce apoptosis of disease-perpetuating T-cells (12), which are
assumed to induce long-lasting secretion of matrix-degrading substances such as chemokines and
matrix metalloproteinases, which promote transmural inflammation. The turnover of T-cells may
influence the dosing frequency. Treatments of IBD patients normally employ a less frequent or
lower dose, when clinical remission is achieved.

The activity of the drug has, in the phase 1 programme, been explored using an ex vivo assay
measuring the level of activation (phosphorylation) of the second messenger STAT-3. The
relationship between exposure (Figure 3a) and efficacy is not known. However, based on ex vivo
experiments, target saturation resulting in a suppression of STAT-3 activation back to baseline
levels is expected to occur above an exposure of 1 µg/mL. Thus, the dose levels for this trial were
selected to test levels of exposure around the threshold.

The 75 mg dose every other week is, according to simulations, anticipated to suppress the second
messenger signal to baseline level for a duration of at least one week and single dose data suggest
approximately 80% occupancy after 14 days (Figure 3b). Both the 300 mg and 600 mg dose
administered every other week are anticipated to suppress the activation of the IL-6/sIL-6R second
messenger signal STAT-3 to baseline, as the trough levels are expected to be >1 µg/mL. The
highest dose of 600 mg is selected to likely cover the highest anticipated dose in the therapeutic
range of TJ301.

This trial is to investigate the efficacy of TJ301 versus placebo added on top of standard of care, in
the induction of response and remission in patients with active UC. The two doses selected are
within the range of doses investigated in phase 1 with dose proportionality in systemic exposure,
and with no evident safety signals. The two doses are selected to give exposure above (300 and 600
mg) full target saturation (expected at the theoretical threshold of 1 µg/mL at trough). The selected
dose levels may enable elucidation of dose response.

3.4.5      Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
During the 12-week Treatment Period, dosing will be infusions every 2 weeks, as administered by
trial personnel at the trial site. Dosing is fixed-dose throughout the trial.

In the multiple dosing parts of the phase I study of TJ301, the maximum dose of TJ301 was set as
600 mg weekly for 4 consecutive weeks (4 doses totally). In this study, TJ301 will be administered
at up to 600 mg every two weeks for 12 consecutive weeks (6 doses totally). The concentration-
time curves from the phase I study indicated very limited accumulation of TJ301 in plasma after
multiple dosing. Although there will be 2 more doses in this study compared with the phase I study,
the averaged plasma concentration of TJ301 will be very similar between the two studies. Therefore
the proposed maximum doses (600 mg Q2W) can be considered safe and tolerable in patients. In
addition, usually it takes at least 8 weeks for the biologics targeting UC, such as infliximab,
golimumab, etc., to induce remission in patients with UC. Thus a 12-week treatment period is

proposed for TJ301 in this study with the purpose that patients to be enrolled will be more likely to
benefit from treatment.

3.4.6       Withdrawal Criteria
In addition to the patient’s right to withdraw from the trial at any time, as well as withdrawal at the
Investigator’s discretion as discussed in Section 4.4, the SRC (Section 3.3) will review blinded data,
for safety.

In order to ensure that standard therapy is not withheld from patients not gaining sufficiently from
IMP treatment, patients suffering a worsening in disease after Visit 5 are to be withdrawn.
Worsening will be defined as an increase from last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, over
3 days (Appendix 1). Such worsening should be evaluated by the Investigator and confirmed by
endoscopy (no improvement or worse) prior to deciding whether or not to withdraw the patient.

3.4.7      Follow-up Procedures
For patients completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled on Day 105 (Week 15).
For patients not completing the trial, a Safety Follow-up Visit will be scheduled 35 days (5.8 - 6.6
half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP.The procedures to be performed during the Safety
Follow-up Visit are described in Section 6.3.

At the end of the trial patients will be treated for their UC at the discretion of the Investigator.

4.2       Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups

4.2.1        Recruitment
Approximately 25-30 sites will participate in this trial.

Each trial site will require potential patients to undergo a Screening Visit prior to randomisation to
a treatment group. Each patient will receive a unique screening number which must be entered in a
screening log that must be maintained at each trial site. The screening number will be allocated
sequentially in the order in which the patients are screened. The results of each screening should be
recorded in the screening log. Selected data for screened patients should also be entered in the
electronic case record form (e-CRF), along with the reason for screening failure if the patient is not
randomised to treatment.

Under no circumstances will patients screened in the trial be permitted to be re-screened for a
second time in this trial, except who need Run-in Period to stabilize the dose of concomitant
treatment per protocol.

4.2.2      Randomisation
After all applicable screening assessments have been performed, patients who have met all
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be centrally, dynamically, randomly
allocated to one of the three groups and will receive a unique computer-generated randomisation
number.

At the Randomisation Visit (Visit 2), patients will be centrally, dynamically randomised in a 1:1:1
fashion to each of the three arms, namely placebo, TJ301 300 mg, or TJ301 600 mg, by validated
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Randomisation will be stratified by prior corticosteroids
treatment (yes/no) and consent to participate in PK substudy (yes/no). . This information will be

4.3.1      Prior and Concomitant Therapies
Details of all concomitant medication will be recorded in the e-CRF, along with the main reason for
prescription. In addition, prior treatment for UC within 12 months of Visit 1 (Screening) will be
recorded.

4.3.2       Prohibited Therapy
Patients will be prohibited from taking any other IMP or undergo any other investigative treatment
during the trial from the time the informed consent form is signed through to at least the Follow-up
Visit, or any other IMP within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to Visit 2 (whichever is longer).

The following previous or concomitant medications are disallowed during the trial:
      •   Immunomodulating/suppressing drugs, including JAK inhibitors (NB: AZA and 6-MP are
          allowed as per inclusion criteria, see Section 4.1.1).
      •   Antibiotics, when given as treatment for UC relapse.
      •   Any biologic drugs.
      •   Any live (attenuated) vaccines.

4.3.3      Other Restrictions
Patients on stable-dose concomitant treatment for UC at Visit 2 must remain on a stable dose
throughout the trial except for patients on corticosteroids; tapering of corticosteroids is allowed at
the discretion of the Investigator.

4.4       Withdrawal Criteria
The patients have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason, without the need
to justify their decision. However, the Investigator should record the reason for the patient’s
withdrawal, if possible. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients.

Patients will be withdrawn in the following circumstances:
      •   A patient’s desire to withdraw for any reason.
      •   Loss to follow-up (every effort must be made to contact the patient; a certified letter must be
          sent or phone calls on three separate days must be made).

    •    An adverse event which, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, necessitates
         withdrawal.
    •    A patient’s substantial non-compliance (e.g. visits non-compliance) after agreement with the
         Sponsor.
    •    The Investigator’s opinion that continuing the patient in the trial is not appropriate. The
         Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if it is considered to be in the patient’s best
         interest.
    •    Patients suffering a worsening in disease after Visit 5 are to be withdrawn. Worsening will
         be defined as an increase from the last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, over 3
         consecutive days. Such worsening should be evaluated by the Investigator and confirmed by
         endoscopy (no improvement or worse) prior to deciding whether or not to withdraw the
         patient.

Patients discontinued from the trial will be invited to a Safety Follow-up Visit 35 days (5.8 - 6.6
half-lives of TJ301) after the last dose of IMP as soon as possible after a decision of discontinuation
has been taken. At these visits, the Investigator will obtain all the required details and document the
date of the premature termination and the main reason in the e-CRF.

In case the patient has withdrawn consent, no new data can be entered into the e-CRF and data are
recorded in the medical records only. Correction of previous data entries and/or entering of data
related to visits/procedures done prior to but made available after withdrawal of consent (e.g.
laboratory results) will be allowed unless the patient disapproves it.

Any withdrawal must be fully documented in the e-CRF and source documents, registered in the e-
CRF as discontinued, and followed by the Investigator/Investigative Staff. If the reason for
discontinuation is an adverse event, the specific event will be recorded in the e-CRF. Withdrawn
patients will not be replaced.

In case the Investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse events (SAEs) or related non-serious
adverse events in a withdrawn patient after trial completion these will be reported to the Sponsor
(Section 8.5).

The Sponsor may temporarily or permanently discontinue the trial at an investigational site at any
time for safety, ethical, compliance or other reasons. If this is necessary, the Sponsor will
endeavour to provide advance notification to the site. If the site or trial is suspended or discontinued,
the Investigator/Investigative Staff will be responsible for promptly informing the Independent
Ethics Committee (IEC) that this has happened. If required by local regulations, the Sponsor will be
responsible for informing the IEC of trial or site discontinuation. In such an event, all trial data and
unused IMP must be returned to the Sponsor.

5.2      Characteristics and Source of Supply
All IMP is provided by the sponsor and handled according to the principles of Good Manufacturing
Practice (GMP).

5.3     Packaging and Labelling
Packaging and labelling of IMP will be performed under responsibility of Leading Biopharm
Limited or entrusted CRO in accordance with GMP/GCP and national regulatory requirements.
All IMP will be labelled with trial specific labels each containing a unique IMP number.
A self-adhesive tear-off label will be included and is to be affixed to the drug accountability form
maintained at the trial site.

5.4       Conditions for Storage and Use
The Investigator will ensure that all medicinal products will be stored at the trial sites in appropriate
conditions in a secure location with controlled access. The storage condition for placebo and TJ301
is -20±5 °C and thawed at the pharmacy and diluted in 250 mL 5% (w/v) glucose. When
reconstituted for infusion, the finally diluted IMPs should be stored at 15-25 °C and used as soon as
possible within 3 hours of preparation. The IMP will be administered as i.v. infusions every 2
weeks for 12 weeks (i.e. 6 infusions in total). An infusion volume of 290 mL will be used. The
infusion time will be 2 hours. Following the first and second i.v. infusion, the patient will be
monitored for infusion reactions at the site for three hours after infusion. For the remaining
infusions, the patient will be monitored for one hour post-infusion only, since clinical experience in
this field has shown that this is sufficient for patients receiving frequent infusions.

The temperature in the storage compartment shall be monitored every working day with a
thermometer and the values shall be documented. Deviations in storage temperature must be
reported without delay, and the medicinal products must not be used until further instructions from
the Sponsor are received.

5.5       Blinding/Unblinding

5.5.1      Blinding
In order to reduce bias as much as possible, the trial is double-blind, keeping all subjects, the
Investigator, and all staff involved in the conduct of the trial blinded to the treatment administered.

Patients will be centrally, dynamically randomised using Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).
The randomisation list will not be available to any person involved in the conduct (Section 5.1) and
the scientists analysing blood samples for TJ301 (Section 3.4.3), and evaluation of the trial until the
trial database is locked.

The bioanalytical laboratory staff is authorized to receive the randomization list prior to the study
conclusion to determine which samples should be analyzed for TJ301 according to standard
operating procedures.

5.5.2       Unblinding of Individual Patient Treatment
An emergency decoding possibility, computer-based or other, will be available to the Investigator
and to designated persons at the Sponsor. Breaking of the blind for individual patients in emergency
situations is an Investigator responsibility. As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the
blind will be communicated to the Sponsor.

The unblinding in emergency situations is only permitted in case of a suspected, unexpected serious
adverse reaction (SUSAR) or other important adverse event, when the knowledge of the IMP in
question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the patient. As far as the
emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by the Investigator and the Sponsor.
The Investigator who unblinds a treatment must record the reason and date for unblinding before
the treatment code can be broken. The Investigator must record the event of unblinding in the
patient’s medical record, including the reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation if this
can be avoided.

In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency unblinding must be
obtained.

If the Sponsor needs to unblind a treatment, the reason and the date of opening should be recorded
with signature, following corporate standard operational procedures for unplanned unblinding of
clinical trial patients. It should be recorded in the subject’s source documents that the code is
broken, why, when and by whom.

If it is necessary to unblind an individual patient’s treatment for the purposes of expedited reporting
to the authorities and/or IECs, only those individuals within the Sponsor whose responsibility it is
to report this information will know the identity of the IMP. Every attempt will be made to ensure
that all other trial and site staff will remain blinded throughout the course of the trial.

Information on whether the blind has been broken for any patients must be collected before the
database is declared clean and is released to the statistician.

5.6       Treatment Compliance

5.6.1      Dispensing and Accountability
IMP will only be dispensed to patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are randomised to a
treatment group in the trial. The Investigator (or his/her blinded designated personnel, e.g. trial
nurse) will maintain a patient Drug Dispensing Log detailing the IMP numbers and dates of IMP
used for each patient during the course of the trial. Used IMP vials and infusion bags will be saved
for drug accountability. The dispensing will be captured in the e-CRF and will be verified by a
Monitor (a Sponsor representative) during the trial and signed off by the Investigator (or his/her
designated personnel, e.g. trial nurse).

A site Drug Accountability Log will be maintained by site personnel. This log will be monitored by
a Monitor during the trial. The log will be signed off by the Investigator at the end of the trial.

5.6.2     Assessment of Compliance
The IMP will be administered to the patient by authorised trial staff at the trial sites and the
procedure will be documented in a separate Dispensing Log, provided by the Sponsor or CRO.

In order to know how much IMP that has been given to each patient, an infusion pump will be used.
The pump will give the exact amount given per patient. The data from the pump will be captured in
the source documents.

5.7      Return and Destruction of Medicinal Products and Auxiliary Supplies
Used medicinal products can be destroyed at the trial site in accordance with local requirements and
when site operating procedures permits after the drug accountability has been finalised, signed-off
by the Investigator, and verified by the Monitor.

Unused IMP vials must be returned to the Sponsor for destruction after drug accountability has
been finalised, signed-off by the Investigator, and verified by the Monitor, at the end of the trial.

a.   If not already signed the ICF during the Run-in Period
b.   Including mucosal biopsies. During screening, diagnostic colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, at the discretion of the Investigator (if no diagnostic colonoscopy with serial biopsy has been performed within one year of
     screening, a full colonoscopy is required, to exclude malignancy), centrally read. Endoscopy conducted within 35 days before Randomisation is acceptable. At Visit 8, flexible sigmoidoscopy, centrally read.
c.   The screening endoscopy should be performed at Day -35 to Day -6 prior to Randomisation.
d.   The scores for stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be calculated as an average based on scores collected from the Patient daily Diary, for up to 5, but at least 3 days prior to each applicable visit. If the patient
     undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy any of the days before a visit, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore for that day(s) should be considered missing. In addition, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding
     subscore will be considered missing for the day of all endoscopies and the day after.
e.   For Mainland China PK subgroup only. At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h after the start of the 1st administration; At the 2nd, 3rd , 4th, and 5th administrations blood
     samples will be collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion; At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336 (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the
     6th administration.
f.   Biomarkers erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and platelet count tests will be be analysed in local sites. IL-6, IL-6/sIL-6R complex, and faecal calprotectin tests will be analysed
     in central lab. At Visits 2 and 8, the patient should be in a fasting state ( ≥8 hours).
g.   Includes haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation tests, and urinalysis assessments. Clinical laboratory test should be conducted -5 to -1 days prior to Randomisation.

    •    Diagnostic colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, with mucosal biopsies. A full colonoscopy with
         serial biopsies with no signs of malignancy must have been performed within the last 12
         months prior to screening (if this has not been performed, the screening endoscopy must be
         a full colonoscopy). The screening endoscopy should be performed -35 to -6 days prior to
         Randomisation. Endoscopic evaluation will be confirmed by a central, expert reader
         independent of the Investigator and the Sponsor.

For Visit 8, the patient should be instructed to come to the visit in a fasting state (≥8 hours).

6.2.5      PK Visits
TJ301 PK will be assessed in a subgroup of patients in Mainland China (24 patients, 8 per arm;
electronically assigned at randomisation and consenting to the extra procedures). Blood samples for
PK subgroup will be collected in as follows:
    •    At 1st dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 6), and 240 (Day 10) h
         after the start of the 1st administration;
    •    At the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th administrations blood samples will be collected pre-dose and at
         the end of infusion;
    •    At 6th dose: pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2 (end of infusion), 6, 48, 144 (Day 76), 240 (Day 80), 336
         (Day 84), 480 (Day 90), and 840 h (Day 105) after the start of the 6th administration.
The actual sampling time will be recorded.
Acceptable time window of blood sampling for PK shows as below:

    •    0 h sampling needs occur within 1 h before administration,
    •    the time windows between 0.25 h and 2 h post dosing are ‘theoretical timepoint ±3 min,
    •    the time windows between 2 h and 12 h post dosing are ‘theoretical timepoint ±10 min,
    •    the time windows between 12 h and 24 h post dosing are ‘theoretical timepoint ±20 min,
    •    the time window of 48 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±1 hour,
    •    the time window of 144 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±24 hour,
    •    the time window of 240 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±24 hour,
    •    the time window of 336 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±24 hour,
    •    the time window of 480 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±24 hour,
    •    the time window of 840 h post dosing is ‘theoretical timepoint ±24 hour.

The patient may be called in for additional unscheduled visits due to safety reason at the discretion
of the Investigator or the Sponsor, unless the patient has withdrawn his/her consent. The patient
may also contact the site due to safety reason for an unscheduled visit. The unscheduled visit may
include additional collection of blood samples for safety reasons. The unscheduled visit may also
include additional assessments deemed necessary by the Investigator such as laboratory samples,
ECGs, or other procedures which were missed at a previous visit. All unscheduled visits should be
described (including the reason for the visit) and documented in the medical/source record, and in

7      TRIAL ASSESSMENTS

7.1       Assessments Related to Endpoints

7.1.1      Clinical and Endoscopic Disease Activity (Mayo Score)
The full Mayo score (13) is a composite disease activity score consisting of four items or subscores:
stool frequency (relative to normal), rectal bleeding, physician’s global assessment, and endoscopic
appearance. The overall range of the full Mayo score is 0-12 (higher scores being worse) and each
subscore has a range of 0-3 (Table 2). The scores for stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be
calculated as an average based on scores collected from the Patient daily Diary, for up to 5, but at
least 3 days prior to each applicable visit. If the patient undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy
any of the days before a visit, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore for that day(s)
should be considered missing. In addition, the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore will be
considered missing for the day of all endoscopies and the day after. The physician’s global
assessment and endoscopic appearance scores will be collected in the e-CRF.

The prospectively defined primary efficacy variable of clinical and endoscopic remission (defined
as a full Mayo score ≤2, no individual subscore >1, rectal bleeding subscore = 0), will be used and
is in accordance with guidelines and literature (14) (15).

The 9-point partial Mayo score, defined here as the sum of the stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and
physician’s global assessment subscores (range 0-9; higher scores being worse) is used for efficacy
assessment at all site visits starting at Visit 2. The secondary endpoints based on the 9-point partial
Mayo score which correlates well with the full Mayo score (16), should accurately predict the
evolution of the effect on mucosal inflammation even in the absence of endoscopy at most site
visits. Lastly, for the purpose of analysing patient-reported symptoms only, the 6-point partial
Mayo score, defined as the sum of the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores (range 0-6;
higher scores being worse) will be employed.

In parallel to the investigator scoring, endoscopic scoring (endoscopic component of the Mayo
score) will be performed through centralised reading for efficacy assessment. Investigator
evaluation must be verified by blinded central reader, with a second blinded central reader in case
of lack of agreement. Note that the criteria of endoscopic appearance assessment in this study are
DIFFERENT from the original criteria in (13). The Endoscopy subscore is modified so that a value of
1 does not include friability. Personnel responsible for endoscopic evaluation should NOT refer to
the original criteria.

The endoscopy completed at Screening and Visit 8 (Week 12) will be sent to a central reading
center selected by the Sponsor. The central reading center will be independent of the Investigator
and the Sponsor. Endoscopic qualifying score will be reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor
(or the Sponsor’s representative) and will be uploaded to a database. The database will be
maintained by an independent third-party contract research organisation (CRO).

  The daily bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
c
  Endoscopic appearance: Normal, Mild (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, granularity), Moderate (marked erythema, loss of vascular pattern,
any friability, erosions), Severe (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration).
Note: endoscopic appearance is not part of the partial Mayo score. In addition, the criteria of endoscopic appearance assessment in this study are
DIFFERENT from the original criteria in (13). The Endoscopy subscore is modified so that a value of 1 does not include friability.


Image handling and instructions for endoscopy will be provided to the central reading center from
all investigational sites directly or from the sponsor (or CRO).

The patient reported Mayo subscores comprise stool frequency and rectal bleeding. They are
collected for up to 5, but at least 3 days prior to each trial visit throughout the trial by the patient at
home, and they are collected in both screening and treatment periods. The Mayo Score is not
copyrighted. The patient reported Mayo subscores will be collected in electronic format (FDA 21
CRF part 11 compliant) via the use of a Paper Diary.

body weight will be performed by the Investigator or a delegated Sub-Investigator (a medically
licensed qualified trial team member) at Visits 1 (Screening) and 9 (Follow-up). Body weight only
will be measured at Visits 1.1, 4, 6 and 8.

The same individual should preferably perform all physical examinations for a patient during the
course of the trial. The Investigator will evaluate the clinical significance. Pre-existing conditions
diagnosed through assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screening
period are not adverse events, but are recorded as medical history. If any clinically significant
abnormal findings are discovered after informed consent or any pre-existing conditions worsen
during the trial, these must be recorded as adverse events.

7.1.3      Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured at Visits 1, 1.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and will include blood pressure
(measured after the patient has been in a seated position for ≥3 minutes of rest), pulse, respiration
rate, and body temperature.

The Investigator should evaluate the clinical significance of the results. Clinically significant
abnormal findings will be reported as adverse events.

7.1.4      Clinical Safety Laboratory Parameters
Laboratory parameters: urinalysis (dipstick), urine pregnancy test, urine drug panel, haematology,
clinical chemistry, coagulation, serum pregnancy test, TB, HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, and CMV
infection test, Clostridium difficile assay, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein
(CRP), neutrophil and platelet count, and biopsy samples (Appendix 2) will be measured at local
sites according to the schedule in Table 1.

Anti-TJ301 antibodies, Pharmacokinetics TJ 301, IL-6, IL-6/sIL-6R complex, and faecal
calprotectin tests will be analysed in central lab; sample collection methods and handling
procedures will be described in a separate laboratory manual.

The Investigator will review the laboratory results and evaluate and document whether the results
are normal or abnormal and whether abnormal results are non-clinically significant or clinically
significant. Pre-existing clinically significant conditions diagnosed as a result of the screening
procedures must be recorded as medical history. If any clinically significant abnormal findings are
discovered after informed consent or any pre-existing conditions worsen during the trial, these must
be recorded as adverse events. The laboratory report will be signed and dated by the Investigator.

For female subjects, a serum ß-HCG and a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at the Screening
Visit (Visit 1) and urine pregnancy tests will be conducted at visit 8 and Follow-up visit.

7.1.5        Electrocardiogram
In this trial, a routine 12-lead ECG will be performed at Visits 1, 1.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The

clinically significant signs or symptoms that are present before informed consent, or pre-existing
conditions identified through findings from assessments and examinations done during the
Screening Visit will be recorded as medical and surgical history at Screening. For planned
procedures/hospitalisations during the trial, documentation should be completed at the time of the
Screening.

7.3.3     Ulcerative Colitis History and Previous Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis
The date of diagnosis of UC, as well as previous and concomitant treatments for UC, will be
recorded separately in the e-CRF during the Screening Visit.

7.3.4        Concomitant Medication Review
Data concerning concomitant medications and procedures will be collected throughout the trial at
all site visits. These data will be obtained at scheduled or unscheduled trial visits based on
information provided spontaneously by the patient or as a result of questioning the patient.

7.3.5      Urine Screening for Drugs of Abuse
At the Screening Visit, a urine drug screening (e.g. cocaine, barbiturates, amphetamines, opiates,
benzodiazepine, and cannabinoids) will be performed. Clinical significance of a positive urine drug
screen will be assessed by the Investigator.

7.4      Drug Concentration Measurements
In PK subgroup, TJ301 levels will be monitored during the course of the trial. The clearance of
TJ301 can potentially be affected not only by the presence of anti-TJ301 antibodies but also by
disease activity including protein loss through severely inflamed colonic mucosa (21).

8         ADVERSE EVENTS

8.1     Adverse Event Definition
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient participating in a clinical trial. It
includes:
      •   Any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the
          use of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.
      •   Adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the
          pharmacological effect of the IMP.
      •   Any laboratory abnormality, vital sign or finding from physical examination assessed as
          clinically significant by the Investigator (pre-existing conditions diagnosed through
          assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screening period are not
          adverse events, but are recorded as medical history).
      •   Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for
          any medical, nursing or pharmacy consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or
          surgical procedures.
      •   Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences.

8.2        Collection and Recording of Adverse Events

8.2.1      Collection of Adverse Events
The Investigator must monitor the condition of the patient throughout the trial from the time of
obtaining informed consent until the last visit.

The sources of adverse events cover:

      •   The patient’s response to questions about his/her health (a standard non-leading question
          such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).
      •   Symptoms spontaneously reported by the patient.
      •   Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed by the Investigator to be
          clinically significant changes or abnormalities.
      •   Other information relating to the patient’s health becoming known to the Investigator (e.g.
          hospitalisation).

8.2.2      Recording of Adverse Events
The Investigator must record all adverse events in the Adverse Event Log provided in each
patient’s e-CRF with information about:
      •   Adverse event
      •   Date of onset (time can be recorded, if applicable)
      •   Intensity

    •    Action taken to IMP
    •    Other action taken
    •    Date and time of outcome
    •    Outcome
    •    Seriousness
Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.

Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.

If a patient suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the patient recovers in between
the events, the adverse events should be recorded separately. If an adverse event changes in
intensity, a worst-case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity
and the longest duration of the event. a

Note the following: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is.
Hospitalisation is not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalisation is. Death is not an adverse
event, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an
adverse event).

Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adverse
event is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset
date is the date the sample was taken or the examination was performed.

For pre-existing clinically significant conditions (diagnosed or observed as a result of the screening
procedures) becoming worse after IMP administration, the date of onset is the date the worsening
began.




a
         Exception: an adverse event with onset after enrolment but before the first IMP administration (i.e. a pre-
         treatment adverse event), which changes in intensity after IMP administration, must be recorded as two
         separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded with outcome “not recovered” and the date and
         time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second adverse event should be recorded with date and
         time of onset when the intensity changed.

Intensity
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3-point scale:

Mild:           Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate:       Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing).
Severe:         Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).

Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the
following:

Reasonable possibility:

There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse
event. The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be
unpredictable in its occurrence.

Examples:
    •     adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP
          exposure.
    •     adverse events that are not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in
          association with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal
          association or the event recurs on rechallenge.

No reasonable possibility:

There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and
the adverse event.

Examples:
    •     known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation.
    •     adverse events common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with
          some frequency during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.

Action Taken to IMP
The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be classified as one of the
following:
    •     No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)
    •     Withdrawn
    •     Interrupted

Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognised standards of medical care to
protect the health and well-being of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines
must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.

If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medication should be entered in the
Concomitant Medication Log.

Date of Outcome
The date the patient recovered or died, or disease condition worsens.

Outcome
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:
    •    Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation
         of trial treatment)
    •    Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity)
    •    Recovering
    •    Not recovered
    •    Worse
    •    Fatal.

8.3     Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest include adverse events observed in earlier clinical development
of TJ301 and those resulting from blocking IL-6 signaling shown by other drugs or investigational
products.

Certain side effects were observed early on during the clinical development program for TJ301,
including infusionrelated reactions, headache, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, diarrhoea, cough, and
decreased neutrophil count. In addition, certain side effects were characterized during the clinical
development of other IL-6 inhibitors (e.g. tocilizumab) and have been shown to be mechanistically
linked to its mode of action and its effect on inflammation. These side effects include neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, lipid disorders (elevation of total cholesterol), severe
infection (including tuberculosis), and gastrointestinal perforation.

8.4      Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcome
If a pregnancy occurs at any time after signing the informed consent form, the IMP should be
immediately stopped and the Sponsor must be informed immediately.

Note that pregnancy itself is not an SAE, and should not be reported via the e-CRF. Contact details
for the follow up on the pregnancy should be provided with the report. The Sponsor may request
additional pregnancy-specific follow-up information once the pregnancy has been notified.

The mother and the foetus must be followed-up at least until the birth of the infant and one month
after the birth of the infant (also pregnancy following paternal IMP exposure). In general, the
follow-up will include the course; duration and the outcome of the pregnancy as well as neonatal
health. If a pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly), this must
be reported as an SAE to the Sponsor according to the procedure described in Section 8.5.2. Any
outcome which the Investigator and/or the Sponsor considers to be related to the IMP will be
treated as an expedited report.

In cases in which a foetus may have been exposed through transmission of the IMP via semen following
paternal exposure, and the pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly)
this must be reported as an SAE to the Sponsor according to the procedure described in Section 8.5.2.

8.5        Serious Adverse Events

8.5.1         Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious Adverse Events during the Trial

      An event is defined a serious
                                                                             Guidance
          adverse event if it:

results in death                          Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported,
                                          including deaths occurring within four weeks after the treatment ends and
                                          irrespective of the causal relationship to the IMP. The death of a patient
                                          enrolled in a trial is per se not an event, but an outcome.

is life-threatening                       The term life-threatening refers to an adverse event in which the patient was at
                                          immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event,
                                          which may have caused death if it were more severe.

requires in-patient hospitalisation or    The term hospitalisation means that the patient was admitted to hospital or that
prolongation of existing                  existing hospitalisation was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalisation
hospitalisation                           describes a period of at least 24 hours. Over-night stay for observation, stay at
                                          emergency room or treatment on an out-patient basis do not constitute a
                                          hospitalisation. However, medical judgement must always be exercised and
                                          when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. if case fulfils the
                                          criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalisations for administrative
                                          or social purposes do not constitute an SAE. Hospital admissions and/or
                                          surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered adverse
                                          events, if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the
                                          trial, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.

results in persistent or significant      Disability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to
disability/incapacity                     conduct normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical

                                       Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether
                                       events qualify as medically important.
                                       Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious
                                       agent via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g.

                                       transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms
                                       or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a

8.5.2        Collection, Recording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
SAE Reporting by the Investigator
All SAEs must be reported immediately to the Sponsor or CRO as soon as it becomes known to the
Investigator and not later than within 24 hours of their knowledge of the occurrence of the SAE.
Investigators will be notified by the Sponsor or CRO of all SAEs that require prompt submission to
their Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). Investigators
should provide written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the Sponsor or
CRO. The Sponsor or CRO will ensure that all SAEs are reported to the appropriate regulatory
authorities.

The Investigator is responsible for submitting the completed SAE Report Form to the regulatory
body with the fullest possible details within 3 calendar days of his/her knowledge of the SAE.

The SAE Report Form is included in the e-CRF system, and must be completed and submitted
according to the instructions provided on the form. In case the e-CRF cannot be accessed and hence
the SAE Report Form cannot be filled in within the e-CRF system, a paper SAE Report Form
should be used and sent to the Sponsor.

The information on the form must be transferred to the e-CRF when the e-CRF is up and running
again.

Expedited Reporting by the Sponsor or CRO
The Sponsor or CRO will report all adverse events that are serious, unexpected and with a
reasonable possible causality to the IMP as judged by either the Investigator or the Sponsor to the
relevant parties within the stipulated timelines. The expectedness is assessed by the Sponsor
according to the Investigator's Brochure.

SAEs will be considered reportable regardless of whether or not the IMP was used in accordance
with the provisions in the protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure.

8.6       Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events

8.6.1     Follow-up of Adverse Events with Onset during the Trial
During the trial, the Investigator must follow-up on each adverse event until it is resolved or until
the medical condition of the patient is stable.

After the patient’s last visit, the Investigator must follow-up on any adverse event classified as
serious or considered to have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP until it is
resolved/recovered or until the medical condition of the patient is stable. All such relevant follow-
up information must be reported to the Sponsor and CRO. If the event is a chronic condition, the
Investigator and the Sponsor may agree that further follow-up is not required.

8.6.2      Collection of Serious Adverse Events with Onset after Last Trial Visit
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the patient’s last visit (this includes withdrawn
patients, Section 4.4), and he/she assesses the SAE to have a reasonable possible causality to the
IMP, the case will have to be reported to the Sponsor and CRO, using the contact information,
regardless how long after the end of the trial this takes place.

9      STATISTICAL METHODS
All statistical analyses will be detailed in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

9.1       Determination of Sample Size
This is a proof-of-concept trial not aimed at confirming evidence of primary efficacy but rather at
exploring preliminary indications of efficacy (not per se restricted to primary only) and safety with
the aim of informing a decision about proceeding into full development. The exploratory nature of
this trial requires a minimum number of patients to be exposed, yet without losing the possibility of
inferring meaningful conclusions.

A sample size of N=72 (n=24 per treatment/placebo arm) patients is expected to achieve a power of
83% of detecting a trend (p<0.05, one-sided) if the true remission rate difference (at Week 12)
between the placebo and highest dose groups (600 mg Q2W) is 30% (10% for the placebo and 40%
for the highest dose) using Pearson’s chi-square test without continuity correction. The trial also
has 70% power to reach a statistically significant result (p<0.05, one-sided) in case the remission
rate difference between placebo and treatment (300 mg Q2W and 600 mg Q2W combined together)
is 20% (10% vs 30%). Considering the dropout rate of approximately 20%, a total of 90 patients
will be enrolled competitively.

9.2      Patient Disposition
All patients screened and randomised will be accounted for. All post-randomisation
discontinuations will be summarised by reason for discontinuation. The number of patients
screened and not randomised will be presented.

9.3      Protocol Deviations
The criteria for protocol deviations considered major with the implication of data exclusions from
the Per Protocol (PP) analysis will be determined prior to database lock and unblinding.

9.4       Analysis Sets

9.4.1     Intention-to-Treat Analysis Set
The Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomised patients with treatment
assignment according to the planned randomisation.

9.4.2      Full Analysis Set
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomised patients with at least one Post-baseline
9-point partial Mayo score value with treatment assigned according to the planned randomisation.

9.4.3      Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set
The PP analysis set will consist of FAS patients who had no major protocol violations that would
impact efficacy analysis with treatment assigned according to the planned randomisation.

9.4.4      Safety Analysis Set
The Safety analysis set will include all randomised patients who received at least one dose of IMP,
with treatment assignment according to actual treatment received.

9.4.5    PK Analysis Set
The PK analysis set will consist of patients in PK subgroup who have at least one after-dose
measurable plasma sample.

9.5       Trial Population

9.5.1      Demographics and other Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics of demographics and other baseline characteristics will be presented for all
patients in the ITT, FAS, PP, and Safety analysis sets by treatment group.

9.5.2      Medical History, Concomitant Medication and Other Safety Evaluations
Medical history will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the
currently available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and
summarised for all patients in the ITT, FAS, and Safety analysis sets by treatment group.

The number and percentage of patients with medical history conditions will be summarised by SOC
and PT.

9.6       Endpoint Assessments

9.6.1      General Considerations
Due to exploratory nature of this proof-of-concept trial, statistical testing will be performed both at
the one-sided 20% and the one-sided 5% level. However, if the direction of the hypothesis is not
self-evident, or two-sided in nature (e.g. testing for an interaction term), two-sided tests will be
performed.

Quantitative variables will be described with the number of non-missing values, mean, standard
deviation (SD), median, and minimum/maximum values. Qualitative variables will be described
with the number and percentage of patients with each qualitative characteristic. Missing values will
not be included in the calculation of percentages. All data will be listed by individual patient and
study visit.

The efficacy data will be descriptively summarized and used for exploratory purposes only.

The Mayo subscores for stool frequency and rectal bleeding will be calculated as an average based
on scores collected from the Patient daily Paper Diary, for up to 5, but at least 3 days prior to each
applicable visit. If the patient undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy any of the days before a
visit, the day(s) should be censored from mean stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscore
calculations for that visit.

9.6.2      Primary Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical and endoscopic remission (defined as a full Mayo score
≤2, no individual subscore >1, rectal bleeding subscore = 0) at Week 12 in the ITT population. This
binary outcome (remission status=yes/no) variable will be analysed by a logistic regression model
with treatment and the randomisation-stratification factors (prior corticosteroids treatment and
consent to participate in PK substudy) as fixed effects and the baseline full Mayo score as covariate.
A patient with missing data on the remission status will be assumed to be not in remission.
Sensitivity analyses, using different analyses sets and missing data handling, will be detailed in the
SAP.

9.6.3       Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints
All dichotomised secondary endpoints will be analysed using a repeated logistic regression model
using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with treatment, the randomisation-stratum, and visit
as factors, the respective baseline score as covariate, and allowing for a treatment by visit
interaction for the FAS and PP analysis set.

Continuous endpoints (e.g. change from Baseline in 6-point/9-point partial or full Mayo Score) will
be analysed using a repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for the FAS and
PP analysis set using the same adjustments as above.

Endpoints assessed at only one post-baseline visit will be analysed using the cross-sectional
equivalents, i.e. a logistic regression (similar to the primary endpoint) for binary endpoints, and
ANCOVA for continuous endpoints (without adjusting for visit, and without a visit by treatment
interaction).

If applicable, AUCinf, AUCt, %ExtrapAUC, Cmax, tmax, CL, Vz, λz, t½ and MRT for TJ301 after the
initial dose at Visit 2 (Week 0) will be calculated by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin
V7.0 or above.

For all patients, serum peak and trough (pre-infusion) TJ301 concentrations over time will be
presented as descriptive statistics.

Exploratory exposure-response modelling of the effect of TJ301 on biomarkers and efficacy
assessments may be performed and used for optimisation of dose in future trials.

9.7     Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance
Descriptive summaries of the number of days dosed with study drug will be provided for each
treatment group. The summaries will be provided for the Safety analysis set.

9.8       Safety

9.8.1     General Considerations
Safety parameters will be evaluated for the safety analysis data set.

Complete data listings and summary tables will be created for all safety information and include
adverse events, concomitant medications, vital signs, clinical laboratory test values, and 12-lead
ECG.

For safety data, Baseline will be defined as the last observed value collected prior to the start of
treatment. No statistical testing for comparison of treatment groups will be performed for safety
variables.

9.8.2       Adverse Events
A pre-treatment adverse event will be defined as an adverse event which occurs between signing
the informed consent form and before the first dose of the IMP. A treatment-emergent adverse
event (TEAE) will be an adverse event which occurs in the time interval from time of start of the
first dose of the IMP up to 28 days after the Follow-up Visit. If an adverse event on Day 0 occurs
before administration of IMP, it will be recorded as a pre-treatment adverse event. A post-treatment
adverse event is any adverse event occurring after the patient’s last visit (see also Section 8.6.2).

Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by SOC and PT using the currently available
MedDRA version. The total number of patients reporting an adverse event, the percentage of
patients (%) with an adverse event, and the number of events (E) reported will be presented.

Summary tables will be prepared for:
    •    All adverse events
    •    Adverse events by causality (reasonable possible/no reasonable possible)
    •    Adverse events leading to death
    •    Adverse events by intensity
    •    Adverse drug reactions by intensity
    •    SAEs
    •    Adverse events leading to withdrawal

A separate data listing will be provided of pre-treatment and post-treatment adverse events.

9.8.3      Safety Laboratory Variables
Clinical laboratory variables will be presented by using both summary statistics.

10       DATA HANDLING

10.1      Source Data and Source Documents

Source Data – International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Definition
Source data are defined as all information in original records and certified copies of original records
of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original
records or certified copies).

Source Documents - ICH Definition
Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records (e.g. hospital records,
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patients’ diaries or evaluation checklists,
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions
certified after verification as being accurate copies, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm
or magnetic media, x-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at
medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial).

Trial-specific Source Data Requirements
For each patient allocated to treatment, the Investigator will indicate in the hospital/medical source
records that the patient participates in this trial and the date of obtaining the informed consent. The
records should document data on the condition of the patient at the time the patient is enrolled in
the trial to enable verification of eligibility. Signed and dated informed consent will be stored and
archived according to local requirements. In addition the following information, at the minimum,
will also be recorded in the hospital/medical source records for each patient:
     •   Documentation of signed and dated Informed Consent
     •   Patient’s name and date of birth
     •   Screening/randomisation number
     •   Body weight and height
     •   Dosing of IMP – date of first and last dose
     •   Occurrence of any adverse events/SAEs (including description and duration)
     •   Medical history
     •   Date of UC diagnosis
     •   Date of each visit

    •    Reason for discontinuation/withdrawal, if applicable

The following documents collected during the trial should be stored and archived together with the
patient’s hospital/medical records or in the Investigator File as agreed upon prior to the trial start at
each trial site:
    •    Laboratory print-outs from central and local laboratory – evaluated, signed, and dated by the
         Investigator or a delegated Sub-Investigator
    •    ECG print-outs/reports – evaluated, signed, and dated by the Investigator or a delegated
         Sub-Investigator
    •    Patient dispensing logs of IMP
    •    Evaluations of physical examinations
    •    Collection of laboratory samples
    •    Demographics

For withdrawals, all available e-CRF data should be monitored and source data verified. Source
data verification (SDV) will be handled the same way for withdrawn patients as for completed
patients.

10.2    Electronic Case Record Form
An e-CRF system provided by an independent third-party CRO will be used for data capture. The
system is validated and access at all levels to the system is granted/revoked following the Sponsor’s
procedures, in accordance with regulatory and system requirements.

Data should be entered into the system timely after the patient has attended a visit or after the data
become available, as applicable.

The Investigator will approve/authorise the e-CRF entries for each patient with an electronic
signature which is equivalent to a handwritten signature.

The e-CRF system and the database will be hosted at the independent third party CRO. After the
trial database is declared clean and released to the statistician, a final copy of the database will be
stored at the Sponsor. The Investigator will also receive a copy of the trial site’s final and locked
data (including audit trail, electronic signature and queries) as write-protected PDF-files produced
by the independent third party CRO. The PDF-files will be stored on a CD and will be provided to
the Investigator before access to the e-CRF is revoked.

Errors occurring in the e-CRF will be corrected electronically. Such corrections/modifications will
be automatically tracked by an audit trail detailing the date and time of the correction and the name
of the person making the correction.

10.3     Use of Patient Reported Outcome Instruments
A Paper Diary will be used by the patients for the reporting of daily bowel movement frequency
and rectal bleeding (blood in stool) for the calculation of Mayo score at each visit. Patients will be
instructed on the use of the Paper Diary. This will include symptom reporting (stool frequency,
blood in stool) throughout the trial. The Paper Diary should be completed by the patient every
evening starting the evening of the day of Visit 1. A separate manual on the use of the system will
be provided to each investigational site.

10.4     Data Management
A set of data management documents will be created under the responsibility of the Sponsor or
CRO. The data management plan will be issued before data collection begins and will describe all
functions, processes, and specifications for data collection, cleaning and validation.

The data management documents will describe captured methods, who is authorised to enter the
data, decisions about ownership of data, source data storage, which data will be transferred
(including timing of transfers), the origin and destination of the data and who will have access to
the data at all times.

10.5      Provision of Additional Information
On request, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor and CRO with additional data relating to the
trial, duly anonymised and protected in accordance with applicable requirements.

11     MONITORING PROCEDURES

11.1     Periodic Monitoring
The Monitor will contact and visit the Investigator periodically to ensure adherence to the Protocol,
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP), standard
operating procedures and applicable regulatory requirements, maintenance of trial-related source
records, completeness, accuracy, and verifiability of e-CRF entries compared to source data. The
Investigator will permit the Monitor direct access to all source data, including medical records,
and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification. The Investigator will co-operate with the
Monitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may be identified as resolved. The Investigator is
expected to be able to meet the Monitor during these visits. When the first patient is allocated to
treatment at the trial site, a monitoring visit will take place shortly afterwards. For this trial, the
frequency of the monitoring visits is intended to be approximately every 6-8 weeks. Frequent
monitoring is expected when new patients have been included; thereafter there may be longer
intervals between the visits. The frequency of monitoring is also dependent on the number of
patients at each trial site.

One hundred percent SDV will be performed. The SDV process and definition of key variables to
be monitored will be described in detail in the Monitor's Plan for the trial.

11.2     Audit and Inspection
The Investigator will make all the trial-related source data and records available at any time to
quality assurance auditor(s) mandated by the Sponsor, or CRO, or to domestic/foreign regulatory
inspectors or representatives from IECs who may audit/inspect the trial.

The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the
principles of ICH-GCP including the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations.

The patients must be informed by the Investigator and in the Informed Consent Documents that
authorised Sponsor representatives and representatives from regulatory authorities and IECs may
wish to inspect their medical records. During audits/inspections the auditors/inspectors may copy
relevant parts of the medical records. No personal identification apart from the
screening/randomisation number will appear on these copies.

The Investigator should notify the Sponsor without any delay of any inspection by a regulatory
authority or IEC.

11.3    Confidentiality of Patient Data
The Investigator will ensure that the confidentiality of the patients’ data will be preserved. In the
e-CRF or any other documents submitted to the Sponsor, the patients will not be identified by their
names, but by an identification system, which consists of an assigned number in the trial.
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor (e.g. the confidential patient identification

12     CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL

12.1   Protocol Amendments
Any change to this Protocol will be documented in a Protocol Amendment, issued by the Sponsor
or CRO, and agreed upon by the Investigator and the Sponsor prior to its implementation.

Protocol amendments will be submitted for notification of IECs and Regulatory authorities, in
accordance with local regulations. An approval by the IECs is required for a substantial amendment,
e.g. one which could affect the safety of the patients, or which entails a change to the scope/design
of the trial.

Changes to the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to trial patients may be implemented prior
to IEC approval.

12.2    Deviations from the Protocol
Deviations from the Protocol should not occur. If deviations occur, the Investigator must inform the
Monitor, and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Any deviation must
be documented (or included in e-CRF data). In addition, a set of deviations must be accompanied
by a description of the deviation, the relevant dates (start and stop), and the action taken. A Log of
Protocol Deviation Reports will be maintained by the Sponsor or CRO. Deviation reports and
supporting documentation must be kept in the Investigator’s File and in the Trial Master File.

12.3     Premature Trial Termination
Both the Investigator (with regard to his/her participation) and the Sponsor reserve the right to
terminate the trial at any time. Should this become necessary, the procedures will be agreed upon
after consultation between the two parties. In terminating the trial, the Sponsor and the Investigator
will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the best interests of the patients.
Regulatory authorities and IECs will be informed.

In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the participation of individual trial sites.
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to, insufficient adherence to
protocol requirements and failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate.

13     REPORTING AND PUBLICATION

13.1    Clinical Trial Report
The data and information collected during this trial will be reported in a clinical trial report
prepared by the Sponsor or CRO and submitted for comments and signature to the Investigator.

13.2      Confidentiality and Ownership of Trial Data
Any confidential information relating to the IMP or the trial, including any data and results from
the trial will be the exclusive property of the Sponsor. The Investigator and any other persons
involved in the trial will protect the confidentiality of this proprietary information belonging to the
Sponsor.

13.3      Publications and Public Disclosure

13.3.1     Publication Policy
At the end of the trial, one or more manuscripts for joint publication may be prepared in
collaboration between the Investigator(s) offered authorship and the Sponsor. In a multi-site trial
based on the collaboration of many sites, any publication of results must acknowledge all sites.
Results from multi-site trials must be reported in entirety in a responsible and coherent manner and
results from subsets should not be published in advance or without clear reference to the primary
publication of the entire trial. The Sponsor reserves the right to be last author(s) in all publications
related to this trial, with a maximum of three employees of the Sponsor per publication. In the event
of any disagreement in the content of any publication, both the Investigator’s and the Sponsor’s
opinion will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication.

Any external CRO or laboratory involved in the conduct of this trial has no publication rights
regarding this trial.

If the Investigator wishes to independently publish/present any results from the trial, the draft
manuscript/presentation must be submitted in writing to the Sponsor for comment prior to
submission. Comments will be given within three months from receipt of the draft manuscript. This
statement does not give the Sponsor any editorial rights over the content of a publication, other than
to restrict the disclosure of the Sponsor’s intellectual property. If the matter considered for
publication is deemed patentable by the Sponsor, scientific publication will not be allowed until
after a filed patent application is published. Under such conditions the publication will be modified
or delayed at the Investigator’s discretion, to allow sufficient time for the Sponsor to seek patent
protection of the invention.

13.3.2      Public Disclosure Policy
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a
trials-registration policy as a condition for publication. This policy requires that all clinical trials be
registered in a public, clinical trials registry. Thus, it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to register
the trial in appropriate registries.

14     ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS

14.1    Independent Ethics Committee
An IEC will review the protocol and any amendments and advertisements used for recruitment. The
IEC will review the patient information sheet and the informed consent form, their updates (if any),
and any written materials given to the patients. A list of all IECs to which the protocol has been
submitted and the name of the committee chairmen will be included in the clinical trial report.

14.2     Regulatory Authority Authorisation/Approval/Notification
The regulatory permission from Regulatory authorities to perform the trial will be obtained in
accordance with local regulations. All ethical and regulatory approvals must be available before a
patient is exposed to any trial-related procedure, including screening tests for eligibility.

14.3      End-of-Trial and End-of-Trial Notification
End-of-Trial is defined as the date the last patient performs the last visit in the trial. At the end of
the trial, the regulatory authorities and IECs will be notified about the trial completion according to
national requirements. In addition, a summary of the clinical trial report will be provided when
available and within one year of trial completion (defined as Last Patient Last Visit).

14.4     Ethical Conduct of the Trial
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the
Declaration of Helsinki, in compliance with the approved protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory
requirements.

14.5    Patient Information and Consent
An English master version of the Patient Information and Informed Consent documents will be
provided for translation and adaptation into local languages. If changes are made to the Patient
Information and Informed Consent documents by the IEC and/or the trial sites, the amended
documents must be submitted back to the Sponsor for approval.

The patient will receive a copy of the patient information and his signed consent.

The Investigator will obtain a freely given written consent from each patient after an appropriate
explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, and any other aspects of
the trial which are relevant to the patient’s decision to participate. The trial patient must be given
ample time to consider participation in the trial, before the consent is obtained. The informed
consent form must be signed and dated by the patient before he is exposed to any trial-related
procedure, including screening tests for eligibility. The Investigator will also sign and date the form.

The Investigator will explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the trial or to
withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without the need
to justify their decision.

16     ARCHIVING

16.1      Investigator File
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining all the records (protocol and protocol amendments,
completed e-CRFs, signed informed consent forms, relevant correspondence, and all other
supporting documentation), which enable the conduct of the trial at the site to be fully understood,
in compliance with ICH-GCP. The study site should plan on retaining such documents for
approximately 15 years after study completion. The study site should retain such documents until
at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there
are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years after the
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents
should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the
hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being conducted. Patient identification
codes (patient names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for this same period of
time. These documents may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to Sponsor,
who agrees to abide by the retention policies. Written notification of transfer must be submitted to
Sponsor. The Investigator must contact Sponsor prior to disposing of any study records.

16.2    Trial Master File
The Sponsor will archive the Trial Master File in accordance with ICH-GCP and applicable
regulatory requirements.

        APPENDICES

Appendix 1 – Calculation of Worsening
For a given day after Visit 4, the daily score for rectal bleeding will be calculated as an average
based on scores collected from the Patient daily Paper Diary for 5 days prior to that day. If the
patient undergoes bowel preparation for endoscopy during any of these 5 days, the rectal bleeding
subscore for those day(s) should be considered missing. In addition, the rectal bleeding subscore
will be considered missing for the day of all endoscopies and the day after. The daily score for
rectal bleeding will be calculated for all the days until the EoT Visit.

Furthermore, for each day after Visit 4, the change in the daily subscore for rectal bleeding from the
most recent visit will be calculated. This change will be referred to as the delta in the daily subscore
for rectal bleeding for that day.

Examples:

    •    Assume that for a patient, Day 30 is between Visit 4 and Visit 5, then the delta in the daily
         score for rectal bleeding at the Day 30 will be calculated as the change in the daily score for
         rectal bleeding at Day 30 from the daily score for rectal bleeding at Visit 4 (see Section
         7.1.1).

    •    Assume that for a patient, Day 52 is between Visit 5 and Visit 6, then the delta in the daily
         score for rectal bleeding at the Day 52 will be calculated as the change in the daily score for
         rectal bleeding at Day 52 from the daily score for rectal bleeding at Visit 5.

Worsening will be defined as an increase from last visit in Mayo rectal bleeding subscore ≥1, over
3 consecutive days. Such a worsening should be evaluated by the Investigator and confirmed by
endoscopy (no improvement or worse) prior to decision for withdrawal of patient.

    Instructions for recording the number of stools and their worst rectal bleeding over a 24-hour period:



      Definition of Stool                    A stool is defined as a trip to the toilet when the patient has either a bowel movement, or passes blood alone, blood and
                                             mucus, or mucus only.



      Rectal Bleeding                        Patients should indicate the most severe category that describes the amount of blood they had in their stools for a given
                                             day.

                                             Among the categories of rectal bleeding, “streaks of blood with stool” means streaks of blood with stool less than half
                                             the time, “obvious blood with stool” means obvious blood (more than just streaks) or streaks of blood with stool most of
                                             the time.

                                             Patients should select “No Blood Seen” in the rectal bleeding section if they do not have stool during a given day.
